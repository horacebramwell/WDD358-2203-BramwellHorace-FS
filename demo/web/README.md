# Web ...ðŸš€

The "web" folder was created following the "[Node-Setup](https://present.yourcode.app/39a7ef40-3aa6-11e9-9a38-61dde94d9e52/0)" demo, which just shows the fundamentals of setting up a server. 

Use this folder and accompanying demo as a quick reference.

## Available Scripts

In the root project directory (not the web directory), you can run:

### `npm dev-web`

 ...to spin up the Node-Setup backend API and the mock web front end
