# React-Demo ...🚀

This folder contains an example React project that generally follows this [demo](https://present.yourcode.app/af6e49c0-4be7-11e9-90d3-85a73e7e935c/0). 

**Important to Note:** 
* This demo is a work in progress. Feel free to use it for reference and experimentation. 
* This code was updated and revised slightly to use [React Router v6](https://reactrouterdotcom.fly.dev/docs/en/v6). 
* This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) (CRA).
* CRA [documentation](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/setting-up-your-editor) recommends setting up Chrome Debugger for Visual Studio ---> that's [out of date](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-chrome-debug/blob/master/README.md#troubleshooting) now and should be ignored. 
* Slide 3 of the React demo is also outdated. See below for details...

**Slide 3:**  This [slide](https://present.yourcode.app/af6e49c0-4be7-11e9-90d3-85a73e7e935c/3) demonstrates installation of ESLint. Create React App (CRA) now uses ESLint out of the box, so installing it again isn't necessary and may cause issues. The only thing that's needed for ESLint when using a CRA app now is a style guide. So, in this example codebase the AIRbnb style guide for ESLint was used. 

When you work on apps using tools like CRA, it's good to check out documentation for updates like these. It's also a good practice when Installing and using ESLint with AIRbnb to review the NPM package information...

**Package Info**  
[ESLint with React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb) - Already set-up when using Create React App.    
[ESLint wihthout React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb-base) - Useful when working on API backend development.  

Pay attention to what a package recommends for installation, and configuration - as this may change over time leading to necessary updates and adjustments to a codebase. Remember to only install a style guide when using CRA, because ESLint is already part of Create React App now. 

**Additional Info:** Be sure to checkout the inline commenting used throughout this code as well.

## Getting Started
### `npm dev-react-demo`

From the root project directory, you can run the above script to spin up an example backend API (see the api directory) and this React front end.   


<br>

## Additional Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
