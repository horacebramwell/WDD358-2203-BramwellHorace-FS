## Progress Check / Stand Up
Each week, I will summarize my milestone activity and progress by including a **Stand-Up**. A "stand-up" is when I take the time to briefly report out on the following...

1. **Accomplishments** - What I worked on this past week
2. **Challenges** - Any challenges I may have (and how I am addressing those challenges)
3. **Next Steps** - What I plan to prioritize and do next 

<br>

**Week 1**: Replace this paragraph with a brief "stand-up" (use steps 1-3 above as a guide on what to write about). Summarize your most recent milestone activity and work. What did you achieve? Are there any challenges? Describe your next steps and how you plan to prioritize your time. 3-4 sentences is acceptable. A stand-up is meant to be a succinct update on how things are going. Use this as an opportunity to report out on progress. 

**Week 2**: Next Stand up... Milestone 2    

**Week 3**:    

**Week 4**:
